## Features

- A simple text editor box without rich text display and search capability.
- Text is edited at the "XML markup" level. XML tags are displayed as stored in the *novx* file. Most of the formatting tags are similar to those of HTML.
- Multiple section editor windows.
- Word count is displayed and updated either live or on demand.
- The application is ready for internationalization with GNU gettext. A German localization is provided. 
- Editor features:
    - Text selection.
    - Copy/Cut/Paste to/from the clipboard.
    - Undo/Redo.
    - Key shortcuts for bold and italic formatting.
    - Create a new section after the current one.
    - Split the section at the cursor position.
    - Navigation to the next or previous section.
    
**WARNING:** With this text editor, you can damage your *noveltree* section content by malforming it. 
So if you don't know what "well-formed XML" means, this plugin might not be the right thing for you.
