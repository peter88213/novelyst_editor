A simple [novelyst](https://peter88213.github.io/novelyst/) multi-scene editor plugin based on the *tkinter.scrolledtext* widget.

### Installation

If [novelyst](https://peter88213.github.io/novelyst/) is installed, the setup script auto-installs the *novelyst_editor* plugin in the *novelyst* plugin directory.

The plugin adds an "Edit" entry to the *novelyst* "Scene" menu. 

## Operation

### Launch the scene editor

- Open a scene editor window by double-clicking on a scene or by clicking on "Edit" in the "Scene" menu when a scene is selected.
- If the project is locked, editor windows cannot be opened.
- If you double-click on a scene already open, the window will be brought to the foreground.

### Apply changes

- You can apply changes to the scene with **Ctrl-S**. Then "Modified" status is displayed in novelyst.
- If the project is locked in *novelyst*, you will be asked to unlock it before changes can be applied.

### Exit 

- You can exit with **File > Exit** of **Ctrl-Q**.
- When exiting the program, you will be asked for applying changes.
